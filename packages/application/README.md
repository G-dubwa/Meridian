# application

Responsibility: use-case contracts and workflow orchestration over domain-owned ports and transaction boundaries.

Exclusions: domain invariants, persistence, provider implementations, HTTP presentation, and worker hosting.

Allowed imports: `@meridian/domain` only. Application must not import any infrastructure package. The domain package never imports application.

Tests: orchestration uses in-memory fakes. Dependency-cruiser proves application-to-infrastructure imports fail.
